# million-songs-big-data-analysis
This project analyzes the million-songs-dataset.


This project uses PySpark to process the million-song-dataset and involves queries that relies on most and least played songs. 

There exists two tables in this database:
- User Listening History
- Music Info

### Music Info 

Information about the song, like 'artist', 'tags', 'key', 'loudness', among others.

### User Listening History

Information about the users and song times played. 


With join between these two tables is possible to have a lot of information. 

Are the keys a key concept of most or least played songs? 

Is the loudness involved to it?

Which are the most or least played artists?


I hope you add more interesting queries. Let's collaborate!!
